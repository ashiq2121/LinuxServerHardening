# Linux Server Hardening

<h2>Description</h2>
Hi there! This is an exciting project, where I explore some of the ways to secure and harden a Linux server. The distribution chosen would be Rock, as it is based on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) source code. RHEL is one of the most popular distributions in the enterprise world, and so working with Rocky would be a good alternative.

- <b>Firewall</b>

<h2>Environments Used </h2>

- <b>Rocky 9.2</b> (21H2)

<h2>SSH Keys for Authentication:</h2>
